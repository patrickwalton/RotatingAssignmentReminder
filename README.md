# Rotating Assignment Reminder
Title: Assignment Reminder

Author: Patrick Walton

Notes: This Google Apps script rotates through a list of volunteers that take turns on an assignment and reminds them when it is their turn. This script requires that you set a recurring trigger in the Google Apps Script editor for the frequency that people need to report on their assignment.
